/**
 * User.username is meant to be globally unique (it's what login looks up by, with no
 * store context to disambiguate) - see the comment on User.username. But on a
 * database that was never freshly created from the current entity mapping, Hibernate's
 * ddl-auto=update never retroactively adds a missing unique constraint to an existing
 * column, so a database can end up with only the older (store_id, username)
 * constraint from an earlier version of this app. That's the wrong scope: it lets two
 * different stores register the same username, which would make
 * UserRepository.findByUsername() (used by login) throw on an ambiguous result for
 * both of them instead of failing predictably at registration time.
 *
 * This runs once at startup and adds the correct global constraint if it's missing -
 * but only if doing so wouldn't fail outright (i.e. no duplicate usernames already
 * exist across different stores). If duplicates are found, it logs them clearly
 * instead of crashing the app or corrupting anything; an admin has to resolve those
 * manually (rename one of the conflicting accounts) before the constraint can be added.
